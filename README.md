Remember to refresh the OpenDota API client every now and then. To do it i'm using https://github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen

```oapi-codegen -generate client,types -package main .\openapitools.json > opendota.gen.go```

Direct [link](https://api.opendota.com/api) to Dota OpenApi could be used but the spec may have some errors depending on the version, in my case i downloaded the last one an corrected it manually.
